## Problem Statement
In layman's terms, the problem required us to develop a system incorporating ML/AI based summarization upon data gathered by crawling news feeds. The use case requires the feeds to be strictly from the Energy and Carbon domain, and any publicly available news feeds in the said domain can be considered. 

## Approach
- The entire system can efficiently be implemented and presented as an end product in form of a dynamic webapp. 
- News Feed URLs can be taken dynamically from the potential product users.
- Apart from News Feed URL, we will also present option of direct News URL input and direct News text content input. 
- These News Feed URLs can easily be crawled to get links of the news articles. The text content can then be extracted using scraping technqiues.
- The text content can then be summarized using NLP summarizing techniques. We plan to customize the NLP models to give better outputs for particularly Energy and Carbon related content.
- Finally, we present the summarized text (news articles) to the user. The system helps in saving time and efforts required in searching for and understanding vast energy related content
